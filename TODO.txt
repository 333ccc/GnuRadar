There are a number of items to complete before the code-base can be considered
simple enough for the average joe. Of course, most users should have a decent
understanding of the system before attempting to operate any high-powered
system. Every program in the system was designed with emphasis on command-line
operation and scripting in mind. GUIs, in my opinion, are useful, but should
only be a light-weight wrapper around the heavy lifter ( a.k.a command-line )
in order to prevent an unmaintainable mess of GUI-coupled logic that will
forever haunt you. 

Here's a brief wish list for the very near future:

   1. Add XML-based message passing to better decouple command-line programs
      while providing inter-process communication.

   2. Replace current configuration files with XML-based versions to
      future-proof ( i.e. replace FLTK with a simple Java wrapper ).

   3. Use boost::ASIO libraries to provide socket-based client/servers to
      communicate messages.
      -- 95% complete 09/03/2010 --

   4. Provide more robust status messaging for gradar-run.
      -- 50% complete 09/03/2010 --

   5. Refactor data types and data arrays to simplify and unify configuration
      and runtime data transfer.

   6. Replace family-size HDF5 setup with the default 'single' file
      implementation. If multiple files are needed for transport, tools are
      available to split files post-observation.
      -- under consideration 09/03/2010 --

   7. Provide a Java-based toolbar to encompass all Java wrappers
      into a single location ( similar to the old radarTk toolbar ).
