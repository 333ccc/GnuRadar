After a successful setup and installation, you should be able to do the
following:

1. start the data collection server using: "gradar-run-server"
2. collect data using the data collection GUI: "gradar-run"

This assumes you have properly setup your triggering mechanism and have loaded
a valid configuration file.

Known Issues:

1. Multiple starts/stops with the same configuration loaded will fail due to
an "existing" data set. This is not a bug, but an attempt to prevent someone
from overwriting their own data. If the files are garbage, remove them and try
again. Otherwise you'll need to copy these files to a new name and/or
location, or modify the configuration file to reflect the new data set's base
file name.
